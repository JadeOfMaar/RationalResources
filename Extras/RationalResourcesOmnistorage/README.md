# Rational Resources Omnistorage Tweaks
This mod allows for compatible tanks to use the WBI OmniStorage module instead of B9PS. Currently this applies only to Ore tanks influenced by Rational Resources Companion but may extend to other tanks.

It also seeks to (currently disabled and experimental) address the storage limit problems of the resources of Classic Stock (of the Wild Blue Industries mods).
