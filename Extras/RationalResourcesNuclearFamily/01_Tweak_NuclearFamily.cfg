{
	// Some engines contain patches that give them specific advanced reactor modules made by Nertea but not relevant to RRNF. Do we override and remove them for consistency of reactor behavior across all patched engines?
	SHOverride = Yes
	
	// Maybe we want better ElectricCharge conversion in our engine so it serves even better as our main reactor. Any bimodal nuclear engines / LANTRs affected by high value here become effective "trimodal nuclear engines"
	TECMultiplier = 1
	
	// Asking for ThermalPower and being throttle limited in response to the reactor failing or inadequate is an awesome dynamic but currently dV calculators break when we treat other resources like we treat ElectricCharge and that really sucks. So here's the option to choose between ThermalPower and dV calculators.
	RequireThP = No
