# Folders

## 000_RationalResources
The greater of the core of this mod. Here are the resource distribution templates, B9 tank types and scanner modifications. Folders for any resource libraries and profiles based on them (hereby called "play modes") are here. These folders will overlap in a very bad way so ensure to keep only one of these in your install. Feel free to create your own play mode folder here.

## RationalResources
The lesser of the core of this mod. In here is the planet pack support and the experiments.

## RationalResourcesCompanion
This folder contains the ISRU opt-in system, and the application thereof (mostly using stock modules), by which fuel cells, Ore tanks, Convert-O-Trons and all breeds of harvester can easily be made compatible with RR's resource arrangements. It also fixes the undesirable, unplayable nature of the tiny stock Convert-O-Tron, and a similar issue in a Stockalike Mining Extension Convert-O-Tron. It is mandatory if you plan to use `RationalResourcesParts` or `RationalResourcesKerbalism`.

The ISRU opt-in system is divided into subfolders corresponding to the play modes defined above. It will do nothing if no play mode is installed.

## RationalResourcesKerbalism
This folder **requires** the ISRU opt-in system in `RationalResourcesCompanion` but contains the application thereof (using Kerbalism modules), by which and all breeds of harvester can easily be made compatible with RR's resource arrangements and Kerbalism. Fuel cells are not supported.

## RationalResourcesKerbalismRF
This folder extends Convert-O-Trons in Kerbalism to cater for RealFuels propellants, and changes the four primary Kerbalism converter modules to not involve stock propellants but the real deals: Not [LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant] but [LqdMethane, HTP, Hydrazine] respectively.  

## RationalResourcesParts
This folder contains RR's Boxed Convert-O-Trons and demonstrator parts such as an ocean harvester, the SolidFuel ramjet, hybrid (Flea, Hammer) SRBs, Panther-based nuclear jet, and other theoretical concept engines.
