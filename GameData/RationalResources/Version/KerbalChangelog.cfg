			change = Added KPBS Ore and LFO tanks support.
			change = Added detection for On Demand Fuel Cells (do nothing to fuel cells; prevent conflict).
		}
		CHANGE
		{

		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix

		}
		CHANGE
		{

			change = Changed Metal, MetalOre resources to be defined with no concern for the presence of EL itself or other mods that may also declare them. Leave redundancy handling entirely to MM's code. This answers edge cases where these resources still don't get defined at all, and consequent issues like B9PS-SSPXr fatal errors.
			change = Updated <b>RationalResourcesNuclearFamily</b> to handle atomic jet/rocket engines.
			change = Updated <b>RationalResourcesSquad</b>'s fusion fuel options to detect CRP to prevent fatal B9 errors.

			subchange = Fixed double-patching of Chemical Plant. Thanks to @ Gordon Dry.
			subchange = Increased slot counts on integrated atmo and exo harvesters (from 1 to 8) so multiple resources can be scooped at once, as it should be. Each slot that is not needed can have an empty loaded into them. Thanks to @ TR_HYDR4.

		}
		CHANGE
		{
