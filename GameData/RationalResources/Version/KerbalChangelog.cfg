	VERSION
	{
		version = 1.43
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Update
			change = Changed requirement of harvesters and refineries from Classic Stock to WBI Pathfinder. When Pathfinder is installed, harvesters can use one module to produce all resources, refineries become switchable and decluttered.
			change = Updated handling for stock drills and refineries to cover for RO Kerbalism which does not handle the stock parts.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Deleted legacy Kerbalism config that caused repeat modules on, and breakage of the stock drills.
			change = Fixed excessive Water demand of Hydrolox production (increased Hydrolox outputs).
			change = Fixed MetalOre and Metal subtypes not showing in Ore tanks. Yay typoes.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 1.42
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added Air Maker OmniConverter option for the presence of WBI Snacks! with Air!
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed output resource flow mode in RR Boxed Compressor and Decompressor.
			change = Fixed template error with JNSQ Lindor.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Update
			change = Updated (hopefully) Extras/RationalResourcesELCRP to catch any resource converters that consume/produce Metal to do Metals instead; consumes MetallicOre to consume MetallicOre instead.
			change = Updated Extras/RationalResourcesNuclearFamily so integrated nuclear jets produce and consume more ThermalPower, and convert to ElectricCharge without needing to throttle up the engine.
			change = Updated Extras/RationalResourcesSquad to handle Kerbondyne branded parts that hold LiquidFuel but not Oxidizer. The presence of Buffalo 2's bioreactor caused an error where MM will not save the config cache.
			change = Updated Extras/RationalResourcesSSPXRTanks to catch all such tanks and replace Metal subtype with Metals.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Update
			change = Updated Procedural Tanks (thanks to @ VeronikaKerman):
			subchange = Alphabetically sorted tank types.
			subchange = Added Helium and/or Helium3 gas form tank types.
			subchange = Added boiloff config for Deuterium and Helium-3.
			subchange = Fixed (hopefully) Ore reappearing after selecting another tank type.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 1.41
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added Extras/RationalResourcesELCRP/RR_EL-RF.cfg
			subchange = This firstly changes the default resource link and resource recipe from LFO to Kerosene + LqdOxygen.
			subchange = This secondly adds other (hopefully popular) resource links and recipes.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added support for Quack Pack (planet pack).
			change = Added support for Real Exoplanets (planet pack).
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 1.40
		CHANGE

			change = Added LqdDeuterium + LqdHe3 options to ProcTanks.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Major change: Rational Resources now favors MetallicOre and Metals instead of Extraplanetary Launchpads' own MetalOre and Metal
			subchange = Added extra: <b>RationalResourcesELCRP</b>. Forces Extraplanetary Launchpads to use MetallicOre and Metals instead of its own MetalOre and Metal.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed SSPXr TACLS patch in <b>RationalResourcesTACLS</b>. An error in root node configs was the cause of serious problems. Thanks to @ Vexxel on the forum.
			change = Fixed "duplicate subtypes: Methane, Methalox" B9 issue.
			change = Fixed repeat tank types in ProcTanks (causes game-breaking bug): MetallicOre, Metals
		}
	}

		version = 1.33
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added Configurable Containers detection to Ore tanks opt-in to cure related MM errors.
			change = Added stock inventory volumes for RR parts except for tanks and engines.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Changed Metal, MetalOre resources to be defined with no concern for the presence of EL itself or other mods that may also declare them. Leave redundancy handling entirely to MM's code. This answers edge cases where these resources still don't get defined at all, and consequent issues like B9PS-SSPXr fatal errors.
			change = Updated <b>RationalResourcesNuclearFamily</b> to handle atomic jet/rocket engines.
			change = Updated <b>RationalResourcesSquad</b>'s fusion fuel options to detect CRP to prevent fatal B9 errors.
		}

			subchange = SMURFF compatibility.
			subchange = Tank volume consistency fixes.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Kerbalism fixes:
			subchange = Added "empty" option for when you want to leave slots open (and save some funds) on an integrated Convert-O-Tron or atmo and exo harvester. Thanks to @ Gordon Dry.
			subchange = Added conditional Graviolium option to exo harvesters, and tech limit to this and Antimatter.
			subchange = Fixed double-patching of Chemical Plant. Thanks to @ Gordon Dry.
			subchange = Increased slot counts on integrated atmo and exo harvesters (from 1 to 8) so multiple resources can be scooped at once, as it should be. Each slot that is not needed can have an empty loaded into them. Thanks to @ TR_HYDR4.
			subchange = Reduced EC demand in atmo and exo harvesters.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Added Configurable Containers detection to Ore tanks opt-in to cure related MM errors.
			change = Added stock inventory volumes for RR parts except for tanks and engines.

			change = Updated Procedural Gas Tank options to try to be equivalent with short 2.5m tanks for NFP ArgonGas and CryoTanks LH2.
			change = Updated Procedural Liquid Tank option to include LqdMethane (unpaired)... CryoTanks does not provide this.
			change = Nerfed the Mk1 and Mk2 SMX generators. They were quite OP.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix

		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
