		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change

			subchange = Enabled missing Alumina, Hydrates, Spodumene Splitters since they don't involve non-CRP Metal/MetalOre.
			subchange = Enabled slot count (as per the opt-in system) to +1 when upgrades applied. If a mod part opts in with, example: 4 slots, it will automatically have 5 when upgraded.
